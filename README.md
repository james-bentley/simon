Created Simon Game, a memory game that utilizes queues where the user is given a pattern of colors and returns the colors after in order.

The game will tell you what colors to click on over five rounds, with the amount of random colors incrementing per round. 

The round number and colors will show up at the bottom of the screen after the "Start Game" button is pressed. 

You will have 3 seconds to click each color
